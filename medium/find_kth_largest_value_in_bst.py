# Find Kth Largest Value In BST
# Write a function that takes in a Binary Search Tree (BST) and a positive
# integer k and returns the kth largest integer contained in the BST.

# You can assume that there will only be integer values in the BST and that k is
# less than or equal to the number of nodes in the tree.

# Also, for the purpose of this question, duplicate integers will be treated as
# distinct values. In other words, the second largest value in a BST containing
# values {5, 7, 7} will be 7â€”not 5.

# Each BST node has an integer value, a left child node, and a right child node.
# A node is said to be a valid BST node if and only if it satisfies the BST
# property: its value is strictly greater than the values of every node to its
# left; its value is less than or equal to the values of every node to its
# right; and its children nodes are either valid BST nodes themselves or None /
# null.

# Sample Input
# tree =   15
#        /     \
#       5      20
#     /   \   /   \
#    2     5 17   22
#  /   \         
# 1     3       
# k = 3
# Sample Output
# 17

# Initial O(n) time solution
