# Three Number Sort

# You're given an array of integers and another array of three distinct
# integers. The first array is guaranteed to only contain integers that are in
# the second array, and the second array represents a desired order for the
# integers in the first array. For example, a second array of [x, y, z]
# represents a desired order of [x, x, ..., x, y, y, ..., y, z, z, ..., z] in
# the first array.

# Write a function that sorts the first array according to the desired order in
# the second array.

# The function should perform this in place (i.e., it should mutate the input
# array), and it shouldn't use any auxiliary space (i.e., it should run with
# constant space: O(1) space).

# Note that the desired order won't necessarily be ascending or descending and
# that the first array won't necessarily contain all three integers found in
# the second arrayâ€”it might only contain one or two.

# Sample Input
# array = [1, 0, 0, -1, -1, 0, 1, 1]
# order = [0, 1, -1]
# Sample Output
# [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, -1, -1]

# Solution
